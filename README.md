## Quick Start Guide
Vanilla AutoTrade looks at the amount traded, which makes sense: more goods means more profits. However, as we all know, this sometimes results in M/L traders running around with only 100 energy cells.

This mod tells traders to look at their cargo limit when thinking about which trade action (i.e. buy/sell) is best. Technically speaking, trade runs that does not use the full cargo limit are penalized.

This mod can work together with my other trading mods, e.g. Station Logistics.
